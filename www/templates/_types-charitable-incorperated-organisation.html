<p>
A charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) is a new form of
legal entity designed for non-profit organisations in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
The main intended benefits of the new entity are that it has legal personality, 
the ability to conduct business in its own name, and limited liability so that 
its members and trustees will not have to contribute in the event of financial loss.
